##What?
Did you ace boggle? Was sudoku your favorite part of phase 1? Have you been honing your algorithm skills at Whiteboarding Wednesdays? If any of those are true, and even if none of them are, you are cordially invited to DBC's first ever ALGORITHM COMPETITION!

You will compete in groups of 3 to complete as many algorithms as possible in 2 hours. 

Come to hangout with other cohorts and alumni, practice your algorithm skills outside of whiteboarding, and have fun!
